WHat is React
  React is kind of library 

  what are the benefits with the react?

   Perfomrance 

   security -- jsx code  javascript and XML
   browser can understand javascript and html,css
   babel(converts) - converts jsx to javascript and hmtl, css
 
 xss - attack - phishing - cross site scripting 

DOM - document object Modal
RealDOM - if we are applying any operation in realDOM t is costly degrading the Perfomrance
virtualDOM - is a copy of realDOM  object tree

     html                                               html
  head    body                       realDOM      head         body
        div  div                                            div     div

Server side rendering vs client side rendering 
SEO - search engine optimization  html meta 


limitations
JSX 
inline coding 

functional component vs class component
presntational componennt  vs pure component present past future 

stateless component vs statefulComponent 


synthetic events -- onclick 


ternary condition

if and else

{data ? data1 : data2 }

loaders 

this.state = {loading: true}

response form backend  this.setState({loading: false});


render() {
    retrun() {

        {this.state.loading ? loaderImage: loading completed}
    }
}

multiple statements

    parent fb page

    child components - profile, sideNav,posts,advt

    changes profile image - profile change the image - profile parent - 
    will make api call - get the response - update the state - api success
    - chuld Component - will display the image 

    setState - rerender parent - all child components should be called 

    parent . 

    this.state = {
        profile: false,
        sideNav: false,
        posts: false,
        adv: false
    };

    after profile change completed 
   this.state = {
        profile: true,
        sideNav: false,
        posts: false,
        adv: false
    };

all childs shouldComponentUpdate 


page 

callback - API calls - std,teacher,mentor -- sockets - will UnMount -- i am unsubscribe or releasing or 

other component - i want add new student -- 


facebook 

posts - profile page

posts - page - we are automatically get the updates - the page dont have the scope - we need to clear the memory unsubscribe 

profile page - i need to show profile info only - i dont show any posts -

checkOut -

shipp , pay, bill, terms, cardDetails


2- guestUser, authenticatedUser

checkoutComponent - componentDidMount - session API Call - details 

SPA - single paged Application 

facebook -- Home, profile , logout , changes url 

SPA - faster rendering, faster loading, easy to view 

ANgularjs, Jquery - we use the library - cdns 

react ANgular2+ -- node - everthing they have been created as 3rd party modues
if we are using react-router-DOM

if we are using fetch, axios API Calls 

users --   /users
createUser -- /users/createUser
2XX - success
200 -- get and put 
201 -- create or post - it will create new record into the database 
204 - get - no data found 

4XX - bad data

400 - bad request - if any inforamtion missing 
401 - unauthorized - 

403 - forbidden - you dont have acces 
404 - not found - not exist 

500 - internal server error  


refs - references 
document 

refs - reference of the element it means we are getting directly DOM Reference 






renderprops - shareing the same code and props logic in different components

storeing in one place and i want to use in multple components 
redux - 


redux 3 principals 

1. single sourec of truth - we are storing store all the data in single place 
2. State is read only - State read the state and we are displaying it.
If you want to change the state, the state changes will be made by reducer 
3. changes are made by pure functions - 

redux
Actions - component to tell the reducer i want to change the state 
Reducer - it will decide whther i want to change the state or not 
Store - wheere we can store the data
View - it will views the data 

component - store 

listen for changes listnes to state i can use mapStateToprops
if want to dispatch any action i can use mapDispatchTOProps

connect - which will connects you from the component to state 

cart - component  listend to add cart action mapStateToprpos return {allItems: state.addedItems}

product - component add a mobile i am dispatching an action (type:'ADD Item', value:{mobile: iphonex} )
accessories - dispatch an action ({type:'ADD Item', value:{aceesories:['headPhones']}})

insurance - 

middleware - we are an action or any state changes we can apply middleware where we can write logs


action-middleware-reducer

context-api - redux-saga

redux-thunk - its middleware- async function - making an api calls 
redux-thunk - by default it returns promise 

promise - which will take only one request at atime and we cant cancel it. It should be resolve or reject



redux-saga - create generators - when want to make multiple api calls and i want to create a new function

context-api - 16.3 - parent - child1- child2- child11-child12 - child21-child22
props - parent - child2-child21
context api - parent - child21
autenticated user - chagellanguage - theme
